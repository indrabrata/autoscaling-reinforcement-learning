# Autoscaling Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains code and resources for the auto scaling reinforcement as my thesis, which focuses on applying reinforcement learning techniques to autoscaling in cloud computing environments for now this applied in kubernetes.

#### Note

- Response time + pod -> buat penelitian
- CPU dan Memori Orchestrator

- Disimpen kalau reward functionnya itu lebih tinggi
- Kalau misalnya gagal, pakek rata rata di timeblock

- Decision Time (Rata Rata)
- Response Time (Client)
- CPU
- Memory
- Jumlah Pod
